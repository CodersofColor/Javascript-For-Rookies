/* It is commonly said that everything in JS is an object in reality that is not quite true.
* when a new string or number is created in JS, it is wrapped in JS object so that is has access to 
* all primitive methods and then the value is returned. 
* ex) const name = new String('name'); --> is wrapped in a JS object type so that methods can live on it. 
* null and undefined objects are the only ones that don't do this.box
* everything in JS can behave like an object.
